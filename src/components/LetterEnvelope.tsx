As I sit here writing this letter, my heart is overflowing with gratitude and love for you. There are no words in any language that could fully express what you mean to me.

You've been my first teacher, my biggest cheerleader, my safe haven, and my guiding star. Through every triumph and every stumble, you've been there with your unwavering love and support.

I remember the countless nights you stayed up when I was sick, the way you celebrated my smallest achievements as if they were the greatest victories, and how you always believed in my dreams even when they seemed impossible.

Your strength amazes me every day. You've faced challenges with such grace and courage, showing me what it truly means to be resilient. Your kindness touches everyone around you, and your wisdom has shaped who I am today.

Thank you for the sacrifices you've made, for the love you've given so freely, and for being the incredible woman you are. I am so proud to be your child.

On your special day, I want you to know that you are loved beyond measure, appreciated more than words can say, and cherished for the beautiful soul you are.

Happy Birthday, Maa. You deserve all the happiness in the world.

With all my love,
Your little one ðŸ’–`;
